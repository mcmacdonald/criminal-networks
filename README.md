# criminal-networks

For this project, I'm computing statistics for various criminal networks from published tie data (see: https://sites.google.com/site/ucinetsoftware/datasets & https://icon.colorado.edu/#!/networks).

First, by comparing statistics over multiple networks, we can establish  regularities & randomness in criminal networks. The goal is to use the local-level configurations in criminal networks to compute comparison networks for use in comparative research, to test external validity, etc.

As I generate R code for this project, I'll share it.
