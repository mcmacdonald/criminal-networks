# criminal-networks

For this project, I'm computing statistics on numerous criminal networks using publicly available datasets. A first objective is to compare different types of criminal networks in efforts to try to establish similarities, differences, and randomness. Another objective is to use the local-level tie structures in criminal networks to compute comparison networks which can be used in comparative research to test the external validity of criminal network structure. As I generate R code for this project, I'll upload it.

I source the network data from different sources:

1) the UCInet webiste, which has 'covert networks' for download, including many classic criminal networks:

2) UC Boulder's index of complex networks:
