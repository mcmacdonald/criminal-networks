# criminal-networks

For this project, I test the typology of collaborative networks against numerous criminal networks. The objective is to compare the three characteristics of collaborative networks (i.e., mutual co-conspirators, clustering, greater degree assortativity) within and across different types of criminal networks in efforts to test the internal and external validity of the typology and to try to establish similarities, differences, and randomness in criminal network structure.

As I generate R code for this project, I'll upload it.
