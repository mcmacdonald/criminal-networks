# criminal-networks

For this project, I'm computing statistics on numerous criminal networks using public datasets (see: https://sites.google.com/site/ucinetsoftware/datasets & https://icon.colorado.edu/#!/networks).

First, by comparing statistics over multiple networks, we can establish regularities & randomness in criminal networks. The objective is to use the local-level tie structures in criminal networks to compute comparison networks which can be used in comparative research, to test external validity, etc.

As I generate R code for this project, I'll share it.
